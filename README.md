# AI-VIRTUAL-MOUSE
The AI Virtual Mouse is an innovative project that replaces traditional mouse input with hand gesture recognition using a webcam. It uses computer vision and machine learning to track hand movements and perform mouse actions like move, click, and scroll â€” making the interaction hands-free and touchless.
