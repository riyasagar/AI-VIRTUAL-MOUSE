# AI-VIRTUAL-MOUSE
The AI Virtual Mouse is an innovative project that allows users to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures, offering a touchless and hands-free experience. This system tracks hand movements through a webcam and interprets specific gestures to perform actions like moving, clicking, and scrolling the mouse pointer on the screen.
